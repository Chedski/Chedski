### Hello!

I'm Basil! They/them pronouns, please. :)  
  
I've been programming since 2014, and I've made a lot of things, including the rhythm game [Sound Space+](https://chedski.itch.io/sound-space-plus) and the chat platform [Vessel](https://github.com/Chedski/Vessel). Programming is something I do mainly for fun, and I enjoy solving problems and figuring out different ways to do things. I mainly program in Node.js and TypeScript (TS is better), and I've made a few games, including SS+, in Godot Engine. I also have a lot of experience with LuaU (also known as Roblox Lua), but that's rarely ever useful.
